            var newText = "Auto-Matic was my Bachelor program's Capstone project at New England Institute of Technology. A highlight of this project is that, even though it was a team of 3, it was solo-developed by me using the MonoGame framework. Similar to the design of this portfolio, with MonoGame, you are given a blank blue screen, the ability to manage content, and a few object classes to make a game. My role for this project was to essentially, build everything. To even begin our game we needed a physics engine and the ability to create maps for the player to move in. This was one of the best moments of the project for me as I had so much to do and I enjoyed the problem solving of discovering every small detail needed for what we were doing. The enemy AI was also programmed by me and I did not, nor did I plan to, use any libraries like 'PathFinder'. As I feel very green in this field, developing a project in MonoGame felt like the perfect opportunity to discover everything I could about the abilities I have been working on the previous 3 years. The overall project started to gain more friction towards the beginning of the end of development. However, with proper communication and open-mindedness, we were able to get over small humps and disagreements. One of the main mechanics was being questioned and was starting to be moved in a different direction than what another member of the team wanted. We didn't turn the situation into a simple numbers game and single out the other person, we talked and came to a conclusion."
            var newText1 = "As for the game itself, Auto-Matic is a Metroidvania that mixes 2D side-scroll platforming with top-down dungeons. Each side-scrolling area (4 in total) ends in a dungeon, and each dungeon ends with a boss fight. Once you defeat the boss, you obtain their weapon and are able to use it in the side-scrolling sections of the game. After completing the dungeons and reaching the other side of the ship (the setting for this game), the player is challenged to defeat the final boss. We were given 20 (with a 6 week summer break making 26) weeks to complete this project as a group and the game should be available on steam!"

            var newText = "Liberation of Color was a GameJam project that was developed in a team of 6. To count, there were 2 Developers and 4 designers. The purpose of an event like a GameJam is to gather people into teams and make a game in a short period of time and minimal breaks. Unlike my MonoGame Capstone project, this GameJam was made in Unity. My roles in this project are as follows: Player Controller, Game Flow (make the game flow between scenes when conditions are met), and Boss AI/Mechanics. This project was to be completed within 24 hours and I feel we were able to accomplish this goal. However, this project, as you're putting a bunch of sleep-deprived young adults into a room to work together for 24 hours straight, problems will end up occurring. As for myself, I felt as if my co-developer wasn't pulling their weight on getting the game to a point where it felt good for me. That is all it was, my own opinions. I never said anything encouraging more work as I understood we were gathered to have fun, but I also knew there was an expectation. I worked to make sure those expectations were met (with very little time to spare), and am happy to say we were able to put the full game on Itch.IO.";
            var newText1 = "For the gameplay of 'Liberation of Color', it is a 2D top-down shooter that consists of two rooms. The first (second image) is more like a prep room. The player must interact with the dark circles on the floor to discover what color you must make that boss' arm. The second room is the boss room. Following a set rotation, the boss moves and shoots at the player. The player must shoot the correct color at the right arm that was shown in the first room. The game was intended to be short and replayable, going from the title to the end and back to the title in a loop.";
