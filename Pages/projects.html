            var newText = "Auto-Matic was my Bachelor program's Capstone project at New England Institute of Technology. A highlight of this project is that, even though it was a team of 3, it was solo-developed by me using the MonoGame framework. Similar to the design of this portfolio, with MonoGame, you are given a blank blue screen, the ability to manage content, and a few object classes to make a game. My role for this project was to essentially, build everything. To even begin our game we needed a physics engine and the ability to create maps for the player to move in. This was one of the best moments of the project for me as I had so much to do and I enjoyed the problem solving of discovering every small detail needed for what we were doing. The enemy AI was also programmed by me and I did not, nor did I plan to, use any libraries like 'PathFinder'. As I feel very green in this field, developing a project in MonoGame felt like the perfect opportunity to discover everything I could about the abilities I have been working on the previous 3 years. The overall project started to gain more friction towards the beginning of the end of development. However, with proper communication and open-mindedness, we were able to get over small humps and disagreements. One of the main mechanics was being questioned and was starting to be moved in a different direction than what another member of the team wanted. We didn't turn the situation into a simple numbers game and single out the other person, we talked and came to a conclusion."

            var newText = "Liberation of Color was a GameJam project that was developed in a team of 6. To count, there were 2 Developers and 4 designers. The purpose of an event like a GameJam is to gather people into teams and make a game in a short period of time and minimal breaks. Unlike my MonoGame Capstone project, this GameJam was made in Unity. My roles in this project are as follows: Player Controller, Game Flow (make the game flow between scenes when conditions are met), and Boss AI/Mechanics. This project was to be completed within 24 hours and I feel we were able to accomplish this goal. However, this project, as you're putting a bunch of sleep-deprived young adults into a room to work together for 24 hours straight, problems will end up occurring. As for myself, I felt as if my co-developer wasn't pulling their weight on getting the game to a point where it felt good for me. That is all it was, my own opinions. I never said anything encouraging more work as I understood we were gathered to have fun, but I also knew there was an expectation. I worked to make sure those expectations were met (with very little time to spare), and am happy to say we were able to put the full game on Itch.IO.";
